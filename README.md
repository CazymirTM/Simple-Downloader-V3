# Simple-Downloader-V3
This one is a launcher downloader (i gave up on launcher downloader name), and now it's the Launcher Downloader but improved.

Just a simple launcher downloader when you make your windows for the first time, kinda usefull or not who cares.

My downloader simply gets (GetUrl) from the .exe exectuables from their actual websites, this doesn't download them from somewhere in my github or other sites.
